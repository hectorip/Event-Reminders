# Event Reminders

In order to learn better Phoenix, I will create an application that will remind
someone about his role in a near event.

This application is intended to help in organizing events that
require participation of several persons.


## Features
-  Register of an organization
-  Define Event types (Conference, Meetup, Dojo, Workshops, etc.)
-  Define Roles
-  Relate Roles and Event Types
-  Calendar for Events (I hope using google calendar)
-  Register a directory of people for an organization
-  Assign roles to people per event
-  Alerts for each one of the participants in the event.
-  Custom Alerts: sms, mail, or phone call.
